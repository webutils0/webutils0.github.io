      This website is a project in creation.
      <br>
      This site will have several types of more or less useful tools depending on the user and situations
      that will help us in certain daily tasks.
      The site is currently being created so expect some pages to not be fully functional and some to not
      even exist yet.
      However, if you have any comments do not hesitate to keep them for yourself.
      <br><br>
      This website was created as a collaborative project between two great engineers that are
      probably very humble people.
      <br>
